ðŸ§  SVM Binary Classification - Breast Cancer Detection

ðŸ“„ Task 7: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

This project demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for both linear and non-linear classification using the Breast Cancer Dataset.


---

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Apply SVMs for binary classification

Explore both Linear and RBF (Non-linear) kernels

Visualize decision boundaries (using 2D data)

Perform hyperparameter tuning (C, gamma)

Evaluate model with cross-validation



---

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

Python 3.x

scikit-learn

numpy

matplotlib



---

ðŸ“Š Dataset

Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset

Features: 30 numeric features describing cell nuclei

Target:

0 = Malignant (Cancerous)

1 = Benign (Non-Cancerous)


Dataset is loaded directly from sklearn.datasets



---

ðŸš€ Steps Performed

1. Load and prepare the dataset


2. Standardize features for better model performance


3. Train SVM with:

Linear Kernel

RBF (Radial Basis Function) Kernel



4. Visualize decision boundaries using 2 selected features


5. Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV


6. Evaluate model using:

Accuracy Score

Classification Report

5-Fold Cross-Validation

ðŸ“· Sample Output

âœ… Accuracy with Linear Kernel
âœ… Accuracy with RBF Kernel
âœ… Best Hyperparameters after GridSearchCV
âœ… 2D Visualization of Decision Boundary (for selected features)

âš¡ How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


2. Run the Python script:

python svm_classification.py

ðŸ“Œ Notes

For full dataset (30 features), visualization is not possible; 2D plots use first 2 features for demonstration.

Hyperparameter tuning improves model performance.

SVM works well for both linear and complex non-linear boundaries.
